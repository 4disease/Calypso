**This project is still under development and is not ready for use.**

Calypso is a unity package for creating simulation-driven visual novels. Usually, visual novels present players with choices and a branching narrative structure to create an interactive narrative experience. Calypso enhances that structure by adding a background social simulation. Characters in Calypso have schedules and social lives outside their conversations with the player. Also, the affects of your actions with one character might affect your relationship with another.

Conversation dialog is authored using [ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) which brings a whole repertoire of dynamic and reactive dialog tools. Conversations are selected probabilistically from a set of conversations assigned to a character and information is filled in from the simulation.
